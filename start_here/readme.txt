If you struggle to understand the proper diorectory structure in the code, download this folder and run (in Spyder Anaconda or in your cmd).
Before you runt he code, open file __init__ and provide a path to ffmpeg filed on your PC. The main folder 'voicecloning' will be created in the *rtvcpl* folder.
There is no documentatio to this code, buyt I left some comments inside the code.
