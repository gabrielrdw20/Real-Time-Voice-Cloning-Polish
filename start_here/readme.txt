If you struggle to understand the proper directory structure in the code, download this folder and run (in Spyder Anaconda or in your cmd).
Before you runt he code, open file __init__ and provide a path to ffmpeg files on your PC. The main folder 'voicecloning' will be created in the *rtvcpl* folder.
There is no documentation to this code, but I left some comments inside it.
Functions in the code can be used separately.
