# Real-Time-Voice-Cloning-Polish

**THIS PROJECT**

The project was created as part of a thesis in an engineering first degree program.

****ORIGINAL SOURCE CODE****

This repository is an adaptation of the original code from https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning and it's German version https://github.com/padmalcom/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning-German

**UPDATES**

Describe model will be updating from time to time when a better model performance is achieved. 

**CHANGES**

The main model (encoder, synthesizer, vocoder) is traind on a Polish audio dataset. Additional .ipynb and .py files were made to help gather, test and modify audio data from web.

**STRUCTURE**

This repository is divided in 3 main parts:
1. Start here - if you have no idea how to create a proper files directory, go to folder "start here" run the code.
2. Modified code + explanation.
3. Additional codes to help process audio files + graphic help to understand some dependencies.
4. Streamlit app allowing to use the model online / onffline.
